# Playlist QuickAdd

This project is supposed to be a tool to help me manage my Spotify playlists and let me add a song to multiple playlists quickly. 

Overall I also just wanted a (hopefully) long term C# pet project that gives me an opportunity to try out new things and gives me the chance to build a bigger project from the ground up.

This project is still in a very early stage and I'm changing my goals and ideas about it all the time.

## Goals

- Gain experience working with WinUI 3
- Learn how to communicate with Spotify API using [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://johnnycrazy.github.io/SpotifyAPI-NET/)
- Learn how to write unit tests
